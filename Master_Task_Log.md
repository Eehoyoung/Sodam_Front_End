### Task #2025-09-08-02 — Startup Crash Fix: Reanimated NativeModule undefined
- Role: React Native Engineer / Implementation Evaluator
- Summary: Fixed app startup crash (TypeError: Cannot read property 'NativeModule' of undefined) by correcting Babel configuration for Reanimated. Replaced non-standard 'react-native-worklets/plugin' with official 'react-native-reanimated/plugin' and ensured it is listed last, as required by Reanimated 4. Kept existing App.tsx stability guards (GestureHandlerRootView, enableScreens dynamic require) intact.
- Files: babel.config.js
- Test: 
  - QR Residual Scanner: scripts\scan-qr-residue.ps1 -FailOnMatch (PASS, Total Matches: 0)
  - TypeScript noEmit: npx tsc --noEmit (PASS/No output)
  - ESLint: npm run lint (Ran; non-blocking warnings/errors to be addressed separately)
  - Runtime: Pending clean rebuild (Metro + Android) to validate fix
- Next: Perform clean rebuild steps locally: 
  1) Stop Metro, clear cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
  2) Android clean build: `cd android && ./gradlew clean assembleDebug` (or via RN CLI `npm run android`)
  3) Verify no Reanimated NativeModule errors remain; if any persist, re-check index.js import order and ensure RNGH before Reanimated.
- CEO 의견
  - reanimation 4.x 버전 이상에서 worklets이 필수적 이번 작업에서 bable.config.js 수정을 통해 reanimation으로 변경하였지만 공식문서 재확인 결과 바벨플러그인은 worklets 단일 사용으로 확인 및 판단되었으므로 babel.config.js는 다시 worklets로 변경하였음


### Task #2025-09-09-01 — LogCat Full Analysis: 2025-09-08_165235

- Test: Analyzer execution (PASS). Coverage proof included in report (Total lines 168,021 scanned). No ANR/FATAL found; minor JS TypeError and one ReactNoCrashSoftException observed.
- Next: (1) Investigate JS TypeError occurrences near lines ~166203; (2) Review ReactNoCrashSoftException context around line 156288; (3) Optionally enhance RN lifecycle marker detection; (4) Integrate analyzer usage into local workflows.


### Task #2025-09-09-02 — Error RCA & Remediation Plan (LogCat 2025-09-08_165235)
- Role: Document Consistency Verifier / QA Specialist / React Native Engineer
- Summary: Created a comprehensive root-cause analysis and remediation plan covering all detected signals in Medium-Phone-Android-15_2025-09-08_165235.logcat. The plan defines hypotheses, fixes, verification, acceptance criteria, owners, and timelines for: JS TypeError (3), ReactNoCrashSoftException (1), Hermes (5), Reanimated (6), NFC (12), Timeout (56), ProcessDied (2), and RN lifecycle markers. Cross-references prior analysis and the remediation analyzer script.
- Files: docs\Error_Root_Cause_Remediation_Plan_2025-09-09.md; logs\LogCat_Analysis_2025-09-08_165235.md; scripts\analyze-logcat-remediation.ps1
- Test/Verify Guidance:

- Result: Plan document created (PASS). Further implementation items scheduled by priority.
- Next: Implement A1 (trace and fix JS TypeError) and A7 (add RN lifecycle markers), then re-run remediation analyzer to verify WARN→PASS.


### Task #2025-09-09-03 — Reanimated/Worklets Configuration Audit & Documentation
- Role: Implementation Evaluator / Documentation Author / React Native Engineer
- Summary: Audited Reanimated & Worklets setup across entry (index.js), App wrapper (App.tsx), bundler/config (babel.config.js, metro.config.js), and source modules/components. Created a comprehensive table document that lists each relevant file’s purpose, whether Reanimated/Worklets should apply, and whether they are currently applied, with evidence. Verified: index.js top-level import of 'react-native-reanimated'; App.tsx uses GestureHandlerRootView; babel.config.js uses 'react-native-worklets/plugin' last; metro.config.js has no conflicting settings. No misconfiguration found; one item flagged for manual confirmation of explicit 'worklet' directive (auto-worklet still applies via useAnimatedStyle).
- Files: docs\Reanimated_Worklets_Audit_2025-09-09.md; index.js; App.tsx; babel.config.js; metro.config.js
- Test/Validation: Repository search inventory for 'react-native-reanimated', 'worklet', 'useSharedValue', 'useAnimatedStyle', 'runOnJS/runOnUI' (PASS). Documentation generated accordingly.
- Result: PASS (Documentation created and committed).
- Next: Maintain the audit document as components evolve; optionally integrate scripts\validate-worklets.js into CI for automated JSI/worklet safety checks.


### Task #2025-09-09-04 — Expo Removal Plan: Bare RN Migration Manual Created
- Role: Release Coordinator / React Native Engineer / Implementation Evaluator
- Summary: Inventoried Expo usage across repo (package.json Expo deps and Expo iOS script; 8 source files importing @expo/vector-icons; index.js contains a global.expo guard; metro.config.js ignores .expo folder). Authored a comprehensive refactoring manual with file-by-file changes, verification checklist, impact analysis, and rollback plan to remove Expo and migrate to Bare React Native.
- Files: docs\Refactoring_Expo_Removal_Bare_RN_Migration_Manual_v1.0_2025-09-09.md; package.json (planned); index.js (planned); metro.config.js (planned); app.json (no change); src\common\components\Icon.tsx (planned); src\features\attendance\screens\AttendanceScreen.tsx (planned); src\features\info\screens\{InfoList, LaborInfoDetail, PolicyDetail, TaxInfoDetail, TipsDetail}Screen.tsx (planned); src\features\salary\screens\SalaryListScreen.tsx (planned)
- Test: Documentation-only; unit tests not executed for this step (Skipped)
- Next: Implement code changes per manual — replace @expo/vector-icons with react-native-vector-icons; remove Expo deps from package.json and replace scripts; remove global.expo runtime guard from index.js; adjust metro.config.js; verify Android/iOS builds; run jest and scanners.


### Task #2025-09-09-05 — Expo Removal Implementation: Branch + Code Changes Applied (Real-time Log)
- Role: Release Coordinator / React Native Engineer / QA Specialist
- Summary: Created feature branch feat/remove-expo-20250909 and executed planned migration steps to remove Expo usage and migrate to Bare RN. Applied code changes in file-list order: updated package.json iOS script (expo → RN CLI), removed Expo runtime guard from index.js, replaced @expo/vector-icons imports across app code with react-native-vector-icons in 8 files (Icon.tsx; AttendanceScreen.tsx; InfoListScreen.tsx; LaborInfoDetailScreen.tsx; PolicyDetailScreen.tsx; TaxInfoDetailScreen.tsx; TipsDetailScreen.tsx; SalaryListScreen.tsx). Updated Jest config: transformIgnorePatterns now includes react-native-vector-icons (removed @expo/vector-icons). Updated Jest setup to mock react-native-vector-icons instead of @expo.
